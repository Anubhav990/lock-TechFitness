                    Achieving a diet with balanced macronutrients, micronutrients requires a smart approach.<span className="bg-blue-100 font-medium text-black"> Macronutrients(proteins, fats & carbohydrates)</span> should be consumed in suitable ratios for energy & muscle maintenance. Proteins (e.g., lean meats, legumes) are needed for muscle repair; fats (e.g., avocados, nuts) provide energy, support cell function & carbohydrates (e.g., whole grains, fruits) are crucial for fueling daily activities.</p>

                    To stay hydrated, keep an easy to carry water bottle. For example, if you have a 500ml bottle & drink from it four times a day, you'll consume 2 liters of water, which provides a simple way to track your intake. Additionally, <span className="bg-blue-100 font-medium text-black">incorporating fruit juices can be beneficial, as they not only contribute to hydration but also provide essential vitamins, minerals</span>.

                    To maximize muscle growth & prevent plateaus, focus on compound movements (squats, deadlifts, bench presses) to engage multiple muscle groups and build strength. Complement these with isolation exercises for balanced development. <span className="bg-blue-100 font-medium text-black">Regularly change exercises by altering grips, stances, or angles to stimulate different muscle fibers and maintain progress</span>.</p>
